This file is the procedure to calibrate Ada Hand Tracker.

1. Initially, one person (demonstrator) should be standing in front of the 
   3D hand sensor without putting any hand in it. The hand
   sensor should be disconnected from power. 
 
2. The person next to system (controller) should then power the hand sensor.
   Baseline values for each plate should be
   printing on the console.
   
3. After 100 values are collected and the average value for each
   plate is calculated, the procedure should be proceed to find
   the max timer count for the Z-plate.

4. The demonstrator should then place his hand as close to the Z-plate
   as possible without touching it. After this, the controller should
   disconnect the hand sensor and trigger an interrupt by applying 5V to
   pin 3. The procedure should move to the "calibrate x-plate" phase.
   
5. Step 4 should be repeated for the other two plates (the interrupts should
   be triggered using pins 4 and 5 for the x and y plates, respectively).
   
6. The console should indicate that the calibration is finished and the
   system has entered normal operation. The LCD screen should display a filled
   circle that moves and changes color based on the position of the demostrator's hand
